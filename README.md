## Scope variations

# Basic excercise

It can be assumed the input is made up of only small letters and space;
no Capital Letters nor !? 


# Medium excercise

The input may contain letters, numbers, symbols and any kind of whitespace,
but the output does not have to keep those.


# Advanced excercise

The input may contain letters, numbers, symbols and any kind of whitespace,
and the output should preserve those characters.
